I have used the basic boilerplate of the html and from then used the following tags for construction of webpages:
1-><title></title> to represent the heading 
2-> <h1></h>  to keep the headings
3-> <ul></ul> for unordered lists
3-> <ol></ol> for ordered lists
4-> <a></a> for adding links
4-> <img  src =" "> for adding images
and then we can adjust the size of the image by using inspect ratio.
